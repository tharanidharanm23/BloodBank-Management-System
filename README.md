BloodBank Management System is a full-stack web application built to simplify and digitize the management of blood donation records. The system allows users to register as blood donors by submitting essential information like name, blood group, contact details, and district. It also provides a convenient way to search for available donors using dynamic dropdown filters based on blood group and district, making it easier for hospitals, organizations, or individuals to find suitable donors quickly. Developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on the frontend, with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB powering the backend, the application ensures a smooth, responsive, and secure user experience. This project aims to bridge the gap between donors and recipients while promoting a more organized and efficient blood donation process.
